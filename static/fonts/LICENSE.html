<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following list is intended to introduce and clarify specific terms used trough-out this EULA.</p>
<ul>
<li>EULA = End User License Agreement</li>
<li>FONT(S) = Digital files containing typeface software. They are organised in weights, widths, and styles that in combination constitute a Typeface.</li>
<li>TYPEFACE = Collection of FONT(S), that are formally related to one another.</li>
<li>LICENSE = The permission to use a FONT(S) on specific conditions.</li>
<li>LICENCE OWNER/LICENSEE (Hereafter LICENCE OWNER) = The legal entity that benefits of the Licence and/or commissions the design work in which the Font is used.</li>

<li>LICENCE TIER = Size of Licence, determined by LICENCE OWNER&#39;s company size.</li>
<li>DESIGNER/AGENCY/STUDIO (Hereafter DESIGNER) = The entity that provides the design service to the LICENCE OWNER.</li>
<li>SUBCONTRACTOR = Third party using the FONT(S) on behalf of the License Owner. Designers are Subcontractor of the LICENCE OWNER.</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>LICENCE AGREEMENT
By downloading and/or installing the Font Software, you confirm to have read and understood the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to expressly agree with them without reservation. Font software shall mean the software developed and produced by GB which, when used with the appropriate hardware and software, allows the generation of the typographic characters (hereafter &quot;Font(s)&quot;) available on GB&#39;s website. Acquiring a License from GB grants the License Owner the right to use specified Font(s) as part of designed content produced and published under the name of, or on the behalf of, the License Owner, and on specified types of media. The design work might be produced by the License Owner or a Designer on behalf of the License Owner. By obtaining a License, the License Owner does not purchase the copyright of the design or any other part of the Font(s), other than the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Font(s) for the use cases specified in this agreement, according to the License Owner&#39;s provided specifications. All other use cases other than the specified ones require an additional License. By downloading and/or installing the Font Software, you confirm to have understood this terms and conditions and agree with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1 BUYING AND OWNING A LICENCE</p>
<ul>
<li>GB believes that the Font Licence should be owned and paid by the legal entity for which the Font(s) are being used. This means a Designer may purchase a Typeface Licence on behalf of a Client, but Client has to be the owner of that License. With this in mind, a Designer can be the facilitator, the purchaser, or the user of a Font Licence.</li>
<li>A Designer can not purchase Font Licence on behalf of one client and use it for another one. Different entities commissioning a Designer must hold their own, separate Font Licenses according to the specific use cases.</li>
<li>Font Licences are only valid within the organisation of the Licence Owner and one initial Subcontractor working for the Licence Owner.</li>
